# Trail-Project
This is a final project for CS101 at Codecademy.  
The project was to write a program using search and sort algorithms that recommended something based on user's input.
The data was sorted using a merge sort.  Both binary and linear searches were used.

I took data about local State Parks and made a trail recommendation program.
Users can choose to filter by State Park, trail length and/or trail difficulty.
Program returns a list of all local trails that fit the requirements.
